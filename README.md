# py-book-infos
Fetching informations on books on internet from partial informations. As an interface to an ms-access database.

Since many sites prevent web scraping from non professionals (like me): I propose a
workaround to make up for difficulties to fetch information from web sites:
- use of a database with ISBN information
- make a web query, manually copy the web page, and get the information from the clipboard
